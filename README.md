# Assembly-Powered-Portal-Gun
A group final project for CDA3104: Computer Organization and Assembly Language Programming.

The goal of the project was to build a control system for a replica Portal Gun (from the games Portal and Portal 2), writing the code in AVR Assembly.

The project was required to have input, output, logical decisions, use at least 1 timer, and use at least 1 interrupt.

This project was completed by Sheryll Jacquet, Katarya Johnson-Williams, Jordan Kooyman, and Bradley Walby. More information regarding the design of the project can be found in the comments throught the source code.
